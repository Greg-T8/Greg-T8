# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile

I am a consultant who specializes in **Microsoft Azure** and **Microsoft 365**. Outside of work, I enjoy diving into programming languages, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies.

Check out my [LearningAzure](https://github.com/Greg-T8/LearningAzure) repo to get a sense of how I incorporate AI into helping me become a better learner.
