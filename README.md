# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I use this profile to document all the things I am learning and working on. I am an IT systems engineer by day where my expertise lies in Microsoft Azure, M365, and PowerShell. 

Outside of work, I enjoy learning about programming languages, cybersecurity, cloud technologies, and operating systems. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in cloud architecture and automation beyond the Microsoft stack.

Outside of learning, I spend a lot of time optimizing my VS Code-Neovim and ZMK keyboard configurations.
